Recorded and Mixed by Greg Heino and Sicko, Sometime in
early 1992
<P>
This was Top Drawer Records' first release - our song is an
early recording of 'fB Song'...I think we recorded it with
our friend Greg in the basement of our practice space; he 
knew marginally more about recording than we did. A later
version of the song was released on the <A HREF="count.htm">Count Me Out 7"</A>
on eMpTy Records.
