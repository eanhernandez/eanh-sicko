My name is Denny and I like to think of myself as lending small town flare to a big city band. Growing up in 
Spokane, WA.  I cut my rock'n'roll teeth playing in bad cover bands and waiting outside the Coliseum for autographs 
of such bands as Aerosmith and Iron Maiden. You probably know too much already.<BR>

While stumbling through college I met up with <A HREF="ean.htm">Ean</A> and we started the quintessential "bad cover band". When that broke up due to 
in-fighting and just plain fighting, Ean and I started an "originals" (not "original") band and nabbed <A HREF="josh.htm">Josh</A> from another bad cover band. 
But the lesson to be learned here is not that bad cover bands are springboards for future artists of tomorrow, indeed they're not! But more 
importantly, that we each had a special skill to bring to Sicko. Ean is a motivational speaker and general Cheez-Whiz wunderkind. Josh, 
being from L.A., is well connected and I have managed to come up with some of the dumbest band names, album titles, and songs in rock'n'roll 
history. Thank you and good night.
