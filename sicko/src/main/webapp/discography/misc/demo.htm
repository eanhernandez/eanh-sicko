This was our very first recording...done in Ean's basement.
We made about 300 copies of this and sent them to places we
wanted to play. Denny's girlfriend at the time did the artwork.
We threw a coloring party when they were done and we all sat
around and colored in the "Sicko" with crayons and markers.
