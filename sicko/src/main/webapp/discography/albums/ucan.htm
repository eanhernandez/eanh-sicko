<A NAME="Half"><B>Where I Live</B></A><BR>
I've got a fear of enclosed places<BR>
crowded rooms and unknown faces<BR>
people staring down at me<BR>
I wonder what do they see?<BR>
And I avoid them at all cost<BR>
to the point of getting lost<BR>
they make me want to run away<BR>
I don't want to play
<P>
Don't think I want to know<BR>
where all my time will go<BR>
I've got enough to worry about as it is<BR>
Don't think I want to go<BR>
everywhere I know<BR>
I've got enough to do right here where I live
<P>
I'm afraid of being lame<BR>
I always want to play the game<BR>
my fears they are always colliding<BR>
I find myself sliding <BR>
tonight you're sitting at home<BR>
watching TV by the phone<BR>
wasting time once again<BR>
I'm not coming in
<P>
Don't think I want to know<BR>
where all my time will go<BR>
I've got enough to worry about as it is<BR>
Don't think I want to go<BR>
everywhere I know<BR>
I've got enough to do right here where I live
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Beam"><B>Beam Me Up, Denny</B></A><BR>
Beam me up Denny, I've got to get away,<BR>
things are getting weirder and stranger every day,<BR>
there's problems with this planet that no one's gonna fix,<BR>
and I'm thinking that we could be making it <BR>
if we were to be taking off really quick
<P>
It's the end of the world and I think we'd better blow,<BR>
maybe Seti 7 to Romulus we'll go
<P>
What are you gonna say when we get away?<BR>
If the situation comes will you rise to the day?<BR>
Or will you kinda be wishing that we would have stayed?<BR>
What are you gonna say when we get away?
<P>
Beam me up Denny I really gotta go,<BR>
things are getting hairy and you're working kinda slow,<BR>
I hope the transporter is something you can fix,<BR>
and I'm thinking that we could be making it <BR>
if we were to be taking off really quick.
<P>
It's the end of the world and I think we'd better move,<BR>
maybe Seti 7 or a Romulan moon
<P>
What are you gonna say when we get away?<BR>
If the situation comes will you rise to the day?<BR>
Or will you kinda be wishing that we would have stayed?<BR>
What are you gonna say when we get away?<BR>
What are you gonna say when we get away?<BR>
What are you gonna say when we get away?
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Your"><B>Your Wake</B></A><BR>
From the first time that we met<BR>
I thought you were so innocent<BR>
I didn't understand what you could do<BR>
now I see that you will never be<BR>
a human being
<P>
And you're still running over people<BR>
like they're no big fucking deal<BR>
stepping over all the bodies looking for stuff to steal<BR>
you're just building bridges with everything you take<BR>
and burning them behind you with the carnage in you wake
<P>
What makes you tick I can't conceive<BR>
flat out refuse to believe<BR>
your marginal propensity to consume<BR>
and now I know<BR>
that everywhere you go<BR>
you're making enemies
<P>
And you're still running over people <BR>
like they're no big fucking deal<BR>
stepping over all the bodies looking for stuff to steal<BR>
you're just building bridges with everything you take<BR>
and burning them behind you with the carnage in your wake
<P>
Now you're finding it's getting harder<BR>
to maintain treading water<BR>
and never look back to see what's there<BR>
but it's welling up behind you <BR>
and one day it's going to find you...
<P>
and you won't be running over people <BR>
like they're no big fucking deal<BR>
or stepping over all the bodies looking for stuff to steal<BR>
no more building bridges with everything you take<BR>
I hope they all enjoy themselves at your wake
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Wisdom"><B>Wisdom Tooth Weekend</B></A><BR>
Wisdom tooth weekend and we can't play tonight,<BR>
Josh says his teeth'll hurt, no way we’re alright
<P>
Wisdom tooth weekend,<BR>
it complicates the company we're keeping,<BR>
it's now, it's now,<BR>
wisdom tooth weekend,<BR>
it's now, it's now,<BR>
wisdom tooth weekend,<BR>
it's now
<P>
Wisdom tooth weekend and we can't play a show<BR>
Josh says his teeth’ll hurt, no way we can go
<P>
Wisdom tooth weekend,<BR>
it complicates the company we're keeping,<BR>
it's now, it's now,<BR>
wisdom tooth weekend,<BR>
it's now, it's now,
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="MySon"><B>My Son</B></A><BR>
I feel sinking on the rise,<BR>
and the faith shines from your eyes,<BR>
my son how could you ever know?
<P>
My own fear of failure,<BR>
seems to surround your life<BR>
life to you is nothing,<BR>
to me it's fear and burden<BR>
Prophesy
<P>
And the devotion she once gave to me,<BR>
is gone and laid at your feet,<BR>
and I am left to sit and think,<BR>
on the greatest thing we...<BR>
we ever did
<P>
You've got my eyes
<P>
My own fear of failure,<BR>
seems to surround your<BR>
life to you is nothing,<BR>
to me it's fear and burden<BR>
It's a prophesy
<P>
You've got my eyes
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Sprinkler"><B>The Sprinkler</B></A><BR>
Looking out my window<BR>
I see some old friends riding down the street<BR>
on the bikes we used to ghostride on the playground<BR>
but I broke my bike last fall<BR>
and my parents were appalled<BR>
at my lack of respect for personal property
<P>
Sitting in the basement<BR>
eating Peanut Butter Captain Crunch<BR>
watching "Flipper" and building models<BR>
but that stuff wears out faster than my All-stars<BR>
lock myself in my bedroom and play with my Hot Wheels Cars
<P>
Layin' in the back yard<BR>
playin' like a rock star<BR>
wish that I could forget<BR>
running through the sprinkler<BR>
until I'm soaking wet
<P>
I forget whatever happened to<BR>
me and all my white-trash friends<BR>
they got sick of me or I grew out of them<BR>
but they must have felt betrayed<BR>
when I stopped seeing things their way<BR>
lost all interest in the stupid plans we made
<P>
But I can still see them skating down the steepest hills<BR>
we were all fearless and our parents feared the doctor's bills<BR>
just having fun was our excuse<BR>
just being cool was the truth<BR>
don't try to stop us 'cause it ain't no use...
<P>
Layin' in the back yard<BR>
playin' like a rock star<BR>
wish that I could forget<BR>
running through the sprinkler<BR>
until I'm soaking wet
<P>
I forget, what you said, not yet
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Kenny"><B>Kenny</B></A><BR>
Kenny you almost made it,<BR>
I'd say you were halfway there<BR>
Kenny your hands are frozen,<BR>
and this is so unfair
<P>
What would you do,<BR>
given a chance to meet God?<BR>
Where did you go, why did you die,<BR>
I was a doctor, so where was I?
<P>
Kenny the moment's passed us by,<BR>
moments turn to days<BR>
Turning confidence away,<BR>
self assuredness to shame
<P>
What would you do,<BR>
given a chance to meet God?<BR>
Where did you go, why did you die,<BR>
I was a doctor, so where was...
<P>
Where was I?
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Ouch"><B>Ouch</B></A><BR>
Agonizing over every word I want to say<BR>
Controlled by fears and consequences of feelings I betray<BR>
flinch because I wonder when<BR>
elbowed in the head again<BR>
minding my own business on the couch<BR>
and I'm ashamed that all I ever have to say is ouch
<P>
Forgetful, regretful, I'm feeling your head full of doubts<BR>
"why do you like me?"<BR>
but I like to complain my low threshold for pain doesn't help<BR>
darling get off my knee<BR>
flinch because I wonder when <BR>
poked me in the eye again <BR>
minding my own business on the couch<BR>
and I'm ashamed that all I ever have to say is ouch
<P>
Well it doesn't bother me quite as much as you think<BR>
I'm just extra sensitive after my second drink<BR>
and there's nothing I can do because I'm constantly annoyed<BR>
these heavy conversations, abrasions I avoid<BR>
flinch because I wonder when<BR>
kicked me in the shin again<BR>
minding my own business on the couch<BR>
and I'm ashamed that all I ever have to say is ouch
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Pain"><B>Pain in the Ass</B></A> <I>(Vinyl Only)</I><BR>
If I could just be nice to you<BR>
would you believe it was true<BR>
I just can't imagine what you'd say<BR>
and if you respect the way I act<BR>
then I've got to figure that you're cracked<BR>
Either way it's probably neither way
<P>
I don't understand I thought you'd never last<BR>
and all the questions that I thought you'd never ask<BR>
and all my tolerance it disappeared so fast<BR>
it's not my fault I'm just a pain in the ass
<P>
I wonder if you understand<BR>
the truth behind an unkind hand<BR>
a blow to let me know I made my point<BR>
that my loss for words left unclear<BR>
answered strikes a note of fear<BR>
appears my visions left you out of joint
<P>
another time I kept my cool<BR>
lost within a world of fools<BR>
remained content in calling you a clown<BR>
it's not like we have full control<BR>
it's not like we're responsible<BR>
and lashing out can only let you down
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Me"><B>Me and Carl</B><BR>
Yesterday, I tried to complicate my life,<BR>
I said, I thought that you'd make a pretty wife,<BR>
and then dreams, of an intergalactic guy,<BR>
pointed, my thoughts to the sky<BR>
And now, Carl Sagan's on my mind,<BR>
Oh God I hope, I really think I hope he's right<BR>
I don't have the time to baby-sit your lonely spine,<BR>
I'll just drink my beer and watch for spaceships in the sky...
<P>
You don't want to know,<BR>
about me and Carl and the cosmos show
<P>
And if I, start to miss your turned up nose,<BR>
I'll call you up, we'll speculate on UFO's<BR>
Because today, close encounters of another kind,<BR>
on PBS made me so happy I could cry...<BR>
I don't have the time to baby-sit your lonely spine,<BR>
I'll just drink my beers and watch for spaceships in the sky...
<P>
You don't want to know,<BR>
about me and Carl and the cosmos show
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Clock"><B>On The Clock</B></A><BR>
This place is always hiring a brand new bunch of morons<BR>
It must be rather tiring, squeezing blood from doorknobs<BR>
This is your life and you're going nowhere<BR>
and it's your fault you're here, it's not our place to care
<P>
I don't get paid enough for this, the stress might break my back<BR>
Working with idiots will give you a heart attack<BR>
'cause this is your life and you're going nowhere<BR>
they don't pay me enough to pretend that I care
<P>
And all we do is sit around and talk<BR>
And dream about the day we're gonna walk<BR>
Smile, you're on the clock
<P>
Here comes Jim the supervisor, everyone look busy<BR>
don't forget to smile at him, he thinks it's a conspiracy<BR>
'cause this is his life and he's going nowhere<BR>
they don't pay him to think, they don't pay him to care
<P>
And all we do is sit around and talk<BR>
And dream about the day we're gonna walk<BR>
Smile, you're on the clock
<P>
Resent the upper management, they treat us like children<BR>
If it weren't for the free doughnuts, <BR>
we'd probably have to kill them<BR>
'cause this is our life and we’re going nowhere<BR>
they don't pay me enough to pretend that I care
<P>
And all we do is sit around and talk<BR>
And dream about the day we're gonna walk<BR>
And laugh about all the clowns we mock<BR>
Smile, you're on the clock
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Sprawling"><B>Sprawling</B></A><BR>
Retracing footsteps down the stairs<BR>
the words that chase me splitting hairs<BR>
down the hallway dimly lit<BR>
Stumble on your wit<BR>
I know I can't afford to be late again today<BR>
I just can't make it there on time to save my life<BR>
Maybe I should just slow down<BR>
and take my time instead <BR>
I don't remember how I got this bump on my head
<P>
Starting off with a clean slate<BR>
now I don't care if I am late<BR>
don't know why it even mattered now<BR>
lost all sense somehow<BR>
although I can't remember facts<BR>
at least I'll finally relax<BR>
let me sleep here on the floor, content with nothing more<BR>
Maybe I should just slow down<BR>
take my time instead<BR>
don't remember how I got this bump on my head<BR>
I was falling down the stairs<BR>
now I'm sprawling everywhere
<P>
My depth perception's not enough<BR>
my senses never pick it up<BR>
leave me floundering in space<BR>
falling down and calling out there's no one there<BR>
and I'm falling, I'm sprawling
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Country"><B>Country</B></A><BR>
A mirror image of a silver sky,<BR>
nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky<BR>
Do you remember now, the oblivion of youthful minds, <BR>
caught up in the fashions of their time...
<P>
Roll away,<BR>
I can see that clearly now, every time I look into this<BR>
mirror image of a silver sky,<BR>
nests of pines and brandy wine, build this country to the sky<BR>
What would they say?<BR>
God is here in this country by the sky
<P>
A  mirror image of a silver sky, <BR>
nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky<BR>
Piecemeal of yesteryear,<BR>
a stained glass moment marking time,<BR>
with full intent on my 22 year old mind
<P>
Roll away,<BR>
I can see that clearly now,<BR>
every time I look into this mirror image of a silver sky,<BR>
nests of pines and brandy wine, build this country to the sky<BR>
What would they say?<BR>
God is here in this country by the sky
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Spider"><B>Spider</B></A><BR>
Coming in out of the heat, a spider crawled across my feet<BR>
it took my by surprise I jumped so high<BR>
it does not understand my fear<BR>
I can't explain what I just did<BR>
it's been with me since I was a kid <BR>
nursery rhymes instilled<BR>
along came a spider, sat down beside her<BR>
and whispered in her ear
<P>
If you've got sense enough to know<BR>
you've got somewhere else to go<BR>
I wish that you had sense enough <BR>
to go there
<P>
It's all I can do to not overreact<BR>
pick you up in a special glass<BR>
kept handy for the occasion<BR>
I call it spider transportation<BR>
You may not want to go outside<BR>
if you don't appreciate the ride<BR>
then I wouldn't go next door if I were you<BR>
you'll wind up flat on someone's floor
<P>
If you've got sense enough to know<BR>
you've got somewhere else to go<BR>
I wish that you had sense enough <BR>
to go there
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Attention"><B>Attention Span</B></A><BR>
My attention span has gotten so pathetic<BR>
and I can't believe I let it get so short<BR>
I can't concentrate<BR>
Everything is just a series of jump cuts<BR>
it's enough to drive you nuts<BR>
until you just get used to it
<P>
It's fucking up my sense of vision<BR>
could you repeat that once again<BR>
I'm stuck on hyperactive rhythm<BR>
is it affecting my attention span?
<P>
My attention span has all but disappeared<BR>
I am everything that's feared<BR>
and is finally coming true<BR>
yeah that's typical to blame it on T.V.<BR>
don't accept responsibility for anything you do
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="You"><B>You Gotta</B></A><BR>
You're feeling like you wanna<BR>
your parents say you gotta<BR>
your friends all say you oughta<BR>
but that ain't you<BR>
You're feeling like you gotta<BR>
you're reading that you oughta<BR>
you're thinking that you oughta<BR>
but that ain't you
<P>
You're feeling like you wanna<BR>
your parents say you gotta<BR>
your friends all say you oughta<BR>
but that ain't you
<P>
You're feeling like you gonna<BR>
you're reading that you shoulda<BR>
you're thinking that you gonna<BR>
but that ain't you
<P>
Sing a song of six pence<BR>
promise not to die<BR>
We won't grow old in here<BR>
We'll live the dreams as we devise<BR>
We'll live the dreams as we define
<P>
You're feeling like you wanna<BR>
your parents say you gotta<BR>
your friends all say you oughta<BR>
but that ain't you
<P>
You're reading that you're gonna<BR>
you're thinking that you wanna<BR>

We'll live the dreams as we devise<BR>
We'll live the dreams as we define
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="YaYa"><B>Ya Ya</B></A><BR>
I'm getting drunk on the summershine,<BR>
she's got the glow of gold in the summer of her eyes<BR>
And there's something in the way and she looks at me,<BR>
in books and written pages that I never thought I'd read
<P>
Now, after so much time, I can see the sun<BR>
I was wrapped so tight, now, I'm undone<BR>
I'm undone
<P>
Seasons in the hills o'er the Brandy wine,<BR>
emptied me of thoughts that I thought I'd hide<BR>
Changing from the man that I used to be,<BR>
in books and written pages that I never thought I'd read
<P>
Now, after so much time, I can see the sun<BR>
I was wrapped so tight, now, I'm undone<BR>
I'm undone
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Closer"><B>Closer to Fine</B></A><BR>
This song is by the Indigo Girls, and you <BR>
can get the lyrics from their 2nd record
