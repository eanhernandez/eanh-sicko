We took along a video camera on our <A HREF="tour1996.htm">tour of the US in 1996</A>.
Some of turned out pretty funny, so we decided to make a video
of it.  It has some footage of live shows in Arizona, Texas
and New York but is mostly of us driving.  We made 50 of 'em
and sold some and gave some to friends who actually wanted to
see it.
<P>
We now have the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PunkRockSicko/videos/1942801755953000/">Full 1996 Tour Video</a> available on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PunkRockSicko/">Facebook Page</a>.  Enjoy!
