	This site is hosted on a server running Microsoft NT Server 4.0 with Internet Information Server 3.0 with Active Server Pages
	extensions. It also uses Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 for the database backend. We use Active Server Pages to generate dynamic
	content which is stored in the SQL database.
	<P>
	So far three sections of the site have been converted to ASP...the Upcoming Shows, Places We Like and the picture picker found 
	under "Rock and Roll Tour 1996" in the pictures section. Accompanying each section is an administrator's tool which provides
	web-based editing tools to edit the content of the site. The administrator's site is unavailable to the front-end user and is 
	password protected, so don't waste your time looking for it.

	As an example, we'll use adding an upcoming show to illustrate how it all works. In the admin tool, there's a form which 
	allows us to enter new shows. We enter a publishing date (when the show listing will publish to the site) and a show date, along with all the other
	information you see on the page...location, venue, other bands, etc. When the listing is submitted, it's written into the shows
	table in the SQL database. The next time the Upcoming Shows page is requested by a user, the page pulls all the shows with a publishing
	date earlier than or equal to today and with show dates later than or equal to today. It then pulls all the associated information
	and generates the HTML which is then sent to the viewer. And, voila, the user sees the new listing. This way, we avoid having to edit
	the HTML directly and our jobs are made a whole lot easier. The other tools work in a similar way. Eventually, we'd like to have the whole
	site converted to ASP and when we do, you can read about it here.
