"Pain in the Ass" Recorded and Mixed by Mr. Kurt Bloch at Egg Studio
Winter 1993 
<P>
<B>Pain in the Ass</B><BR>
If I could just be nice to you<BR>
would you believe it was true<BR>
I just can't imagine what you'd say<BR>
and if you respect the way I act<BR>
then I've got to figure that you're cracked<BR>
Either way it's probably neither way
<P>
I don't understand I thought you'd never last<BR>
and all the questions that I thought you'd never ask<BR>
and all my tolerance it disappeared so fast<BR>
it's not my fault I'm just a pain in the ass
<P>
I wonder if you understand<BR>
the truth behind an unkind hand<BR>
a blow to let me know I made my point<BR>
that my loss for words left unclear<BR>
answered strikes a note of fear<BR>
appears my visions left you out of joint
<P>
another time I kept my cool<BR>
lost within a world of fools<BR>
remained content in calling you a clown<BR>
it's not like we have full control<BR>
it's not like we're responsible<BR>
and lashing out can only let you down
<BR><BR><BR>
