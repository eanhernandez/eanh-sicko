		The construction of this site began in 1994 when Josh, newly interested in computers, bought himself "Creating Cool Web Pages With HTML". Looking at his first
		effort, you could tell. Complete with missing BODY tags and a really lame tiled image background, the site contained almost all the information
		you see here today. A few years later, Josh got himself a job at an online development company and began learning
		how to build real web sites. Complete with the job came a rather contentious designer named Nichole who insisted she redesign the site, which she did. We were all
		very proud of the final creation...the main site featured some neat Flash and there was even an alternate site without the Flash for the hardware impaired. Not long ago,
		we moved the site to a hosting service which provides NT Servers and were finally able to build a dynamic, SQL-driven site, which we're in the process of implementing. 
		<P>
		So who's responsible? Check out the <B><A HREF="credits.htm">credits</A></B> if you're really that interested.  There's also a <B><A HREF="technical.htm">technical page</A></B> devoted to the
		smart guys which explains what we're doing on the backend to bring you what you see on the front end.
		<P>
		All images were created or processed with Adobe Photoshop 4 and Equilibrium Debabelizer. The HTML was written mostly in either notepad or a telnet window, and Helios Textpad came in handy for searching and replacing with regular expressions.
