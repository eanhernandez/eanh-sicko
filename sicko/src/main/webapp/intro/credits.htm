This page was designed and created by Nichole Engel. Based on the layout of the original Sicko Home page, she put in countless hours of creativity and imagination out of the kindness of her heart
for some reason unknown to any of us.  Nichole came up with the design, the art, and the implementation. We think the final product is pretty fucking cool...she deserves all 
the praise and glory on this one.  Content is by Josh, Ean, Denny. The Active Server and SQL development is by Josh and Ean and is discussed on the <B><A HREF="technical.htm">technical page</A></B>.
<P>
Photos from the pictures section are by Josh, Ean, Denny, Benson, and Guerren.  Promo pics are by Alice Wheeler.
