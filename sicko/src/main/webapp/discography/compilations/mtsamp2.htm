<B>An Indie Rock Daydream</B> <I>(Previously unreleased)</I> 
<BR>
Rock and roll saturday night people watching me play<BR>
but we're playing at the YMCA<BR>
we've danced on stages from Spain to Tokyo<BR>
and we've slept on the floors of the world
<P>
these are the days that I will remember<BR>
these are the days that I will remember<BR>
the wide eyed moments of an indie rock daydream<BR>
soon enough, this'll all be gone
<P>
Pretty girl smiling at me, I'm smiling myself<BR>
but she's leaving with somebody else<BR>
I don't care if things never change<BR>
cause at this point success would seem strange
<P>
these are the days that I will remember<BR>
these are the days that I will remember<BR>
the wide eyed moments of an indie rock daydream<BR>
soon enough, this'll all be gone

We also do Wave Motion Gun, which
is the same recording and mix as
as the song on the <A HREF="../albums/laugh.htm">Monkey Boy LP.</A>
