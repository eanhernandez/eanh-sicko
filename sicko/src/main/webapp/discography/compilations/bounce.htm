<B>Escape Velocity</B> <I>(Previously unreleased)</I><BR>
Seen enough rock shows to put me to sleep<BR>
watched enough TV to make the average person weak<BR>
when everybody's getting on my case<BR>
disconnect, push eject, blast off into space
<P>
Escape velocity is what I need<BR>
escape velocity I think I can achieve<BR>
with enough force and aerodynamics
<P>
There's too many folks in this town<BR>
sunny day, they all say let's go drive around<BR>
why doesn't anybody ever walk<BR>
takes an hour just to drive a single city block
<P>
Escape velocity will take me away<BR>
escape velocity just might save the day<BR>
with enough force and aerodynamics
<P>
It isn't everyday that I can't stand it<BR>
but once in a while I feel the need to leave the planet<BR>
ahead of my time and behind you all the way<BR>
but one more thing will send me off<BR>
to keep the dogs at bay

<B>Hipster Boyfriend</B> <I>(Previously unreleased)</I><BR> 
She's got a hipster boy and he wears some black clunky shoes<BR>
and he likes to smoke American Spirit cigarettes<BR>
and he's got a gas station jacket that says his name is Moe<BR>
and he hangs out at all the punk punk punk punk punk punk punk punk rock shows
<P>
Hipster boyfriend<BR>
Hipster boyfriend<BR>
She's got a hipster boyfriend<BR>
and she loves him so
<P>
She's got a hipster boyfriend and he drives a white Dodge Dart<BR>
when they go out shopping at thrift stores<BR>
they wear slanted plastic glasses when it's bright<BR>
and they're gonna go home and read Gearhead tonight!
