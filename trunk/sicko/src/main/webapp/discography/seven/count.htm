<A NAME="Count"><B>Count Me Out</B></A><BR>
I understand my friends have all<BR>
got something to do tonight<BR>
but couldn't someone give me a call<BR>
to see if I'm gonna be alright<BR>
sitting in front of my T.V. set<BR>
filling my heart with regret<BR>
I never did anything I wanted to
<P>
Now I've got nothing to do<BR>
and I'm trying to pull through<BR>
got no help, left no doubt<BR>
you can count me out
<P>
Need to move so I go to the store<BR>
drank all the beer need to buy some more<BR>
stopped off in the park on my way home <BR>
sat on the swings and thought about things<BR>
felt like a puppet dangling on strings<BR>
somebody walks by I hope they leave me alone
<P>
Just wish that there was always someone around<BR>
who didn't drive me up a wall<BR>
seems like everyone they drag me down<BR>
with friends like that who needs friends at all
<P>
<A NAME="Broken"><B>Broken String</B></A><BR>
If I could find a way to change today<BR>
the way I sing and how I play<BR>
I couldn't change a goddamn thing <BR>
If I can't change a broken string<BR>
frustration gets the best of me<BR>
vehemence will not let me be<BR>
relaxed and gentle when I'm playing<BR>
while the metal is decaying
<P>
I go to so many shows my ears are always ringing<BR>
and if I go deaf then I won't have to hear my lousy singing<BR>
and if things are going my way<BR>
it doesn't mean a thing <BR>
'cause tomorrow I could have another broken string
<P>
Well I don't know how to solve my problem<BR>
so many times I've felt so dumb<BR>
seems like it's a total flop<BR>
when all the action has to stop<BR>
Ean sighs the punks just stare<BR>
Josh runs his fingers through his hair<BR>
get so tense my hands are shaking<BR>
I can't afford all the strings I'm breaking
<P>
<A NAME="Kathy"><B>Kathy's Dance</B></A><BR>
There's a girl that we all know<BR>
she dances to the right and slow<BR>
got the means and way to say, "sicko"<BR>
any moment now
<P>
She got the way<BR>
She got the way to say
<P>
It's Kathy's dance<BR>
She gets stoned<BR>
Leave me alone
<P>
<A NAME="fB"><B>fB Song</B></A><BR>
I'm not a product of your environment<BR>
I don't hold these truths to be self-evident<BR>
I don't necessarily hate the establishment<BR>
but I don't think you really know what I meant what I said<BR>
I meant what I said
