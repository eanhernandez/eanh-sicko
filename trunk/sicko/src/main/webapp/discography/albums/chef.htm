<A NAME="Half"><B>Half the Battle</B></A><BR>
Timing is everything I said with a smile<BR>
maybe that's been your problem all along<BR>
it makes a difference in how you do<BR>
between coasting or just crashing through<BR>
some way some how somebody steered you wrong
<P>
It's only half the battle<BR>
I don't know the other half<BR>
that's not the point it's a figure of speech<BR>
It's only half the battle<BR>
but it's always worth a laugh<BR>
without it all the rest is out of reach
<P>
You'd think that knowledge would count for more than that<BR>
the end result of all that you discover<BR>
It maybe just a cliche<BR>
but you'll choke on it some day<BR>
if you can't get the words right<BR>
you're gonna suffer
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Hate"><B>I Hate Big Deal People</B></A><BR>
I hate big deal people, man they totally bog<BR>
It always seems like people gotta totally freak<BR>
on the most unimportant insignificant things<BR>
what's the point in being mad all the time<BR>
I don't know
<P>
I hate big deal people, man they're totally weak<BR>
We can't sit here and we've gotta sit there<BR>
can't you see that I don't care<BR>
What's the point in being there all the time<BR>
I don't know
<P>
Leave me alone, go away<BR>
If it's such a big deal<BR>
I don't wanna play
<P>
I hate big deal people and I'm sure that they hate me<BR>
If people could lighten up and have a good time<BR>
the time I gotta spend with them, I wouldn't mind<BR>
what's the point in being mad all the time<BR>
I don't know
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Dont"><B>Don't Ask Don't Tell</B></A><BR>
Over a coffee cup that's steaming up my glasses<BR>
is this another staredown or are you entering stasis<BR>
feels like the Star Chamber just ordered execution<BR>
way too mad to feel too sad<BR>
it's death by dissolution
<P>
Looks like you came here with a task<BR>
if you don't want to know don't ask<BR>
probably make you feel like hell<BR>
never saw it coming don't ask don't tell
<P>
Imagine my surprise I'm too numb to be embarrassed<BR>
another tactic you employ is this just meant to scare us<BR>
another cup of coffee and all is understood<BR>
glasses fogged up once again the future's looking good
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Rat"><B>60 Pound Mall Rats</B></A><BR>
Today I made the mistake <BR>
of entering their domain<BR>
I may never escape<BR>
my loss will be their gain
<P>
Hear their warning call<BR>
don't go to the mall<BR>
we need a bigger breed of cats<BR>
cornered like raccoons<BR>
hope they get here soon<BR>
save us from the sixty pound mall rats
<P>
They can smell your fear<BR>
and see the sweat drip off your brow<BR>
they will circle you and leer<BR>
make a run for it right now
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Dateless"><B>The Dateless Losers</B></A><BR>
My friends and I we're a bunch of geeks<BR>
so none of us has got a date at the end of the week<BR>
and if there's no cool hip punk rock show<BR>
Denny, Robin, and Woodsy's house is the place that we go
<P>
Dateless losers we don't care<BR>
if our pathetic love lives go nowhere<BR>
No matter where my life has led<BR>
I still have a "L" stuck to my forehead
<P>
We are the dateless losers<BR>
and even though I can't get a date<BR>
I've got somewhere to be tonight
<P>
We sit around and eat ice cream<BR>
crack jokes and watch really bad T.V.<BR>
and if you're a dateless loser too<BR>
then startin' a dateless loser club is the only thing left to do
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Cover"><B>Cover Up</B></A><BR>
If I blow my head off talking to you<BR>
I know a tape recorder's got nothing to do<BR>
with a lack of interest in living life<BR>
when a hundred pound depression straps down tight
<P>
does anybody hear me<BR>
does anybody care<BR>
is anybody listening<BR>
is anybody up there
<P>
covered my eyes up Sunday morning<BR>
from the momentary lack of stable ground<BR>
looked for you and the room was spinning<BR>
you left me hanging with nothing but me around
<P>
If I pull my heart out thinking of you<BR>
and then the holes in the skin come bleeding through<BR>
what's the point in keeping on<BR>
when a whole and a half of the half's gone
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="OCC"><B>Obsessive Compulsive Complainers</B></A><BR>
Obsessive Compulsive Complainers syndrome is taking over rock<BR>
it seems like no one feels like they belong<BR>
all of the kids can relate to self-hate<BR>
they don't want a pep talk<BR>
a million screaming outcasts can't be wrong
<P>
I don't wanna, I'm not gonna<BR>
my life's a fuckin' waste<BR>
and you're paying me to stand here and complain
<P>
I have gone nowhere but that doesn't phase me<BR>
I've done it for so long<BR>
and don't they say that it's never too late<BR>
and all of the girls I know are crazy<BR>
but they make for funny songs<BR>
don't understand why I can't get a date
<P>
I can't get no, I can't let go<BR>
I'm a basket case<BR>
and you'll never understand a thing I'm saying<BR>
but you're paying me to stand here and complain
<P>
Obsessive Compulsive Complainers syndrome <BR>
is my get-rich-quick scheme<BR>
keep the fame 'cause that's not what I'm after<BR>
but as long as I'm here then I'll shed a tear<BR>
and sing about broken dreams<BR>
My life can't be enough of a disaster
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Space"><B>You Are A Space Alien</B></A><BR>
Looking at you from across the table<BR>
discussion is ready, willing, and able<BR>
but something's on your mind or maybe it's not...
<P>
I'm wondering what's going on<BR>
do conversations make sense where you come from<BR>
and then revelation hits me from out of the blue...
<P>
It's the simplest, most consistent, logical explanation<BR>
for why you are so weird
<P>
You are a space alien<BR>
what planet are you from<BR>
you are a space alien<BR>
I think that you're so dumb
<P>
There's a blank expression set on your face<BR>
are you communicating with friends in outer space<BR>
or are social connections a problem wherever you go
<P>
All the signs point to one place<BR>
you are an alien from outer space<BR>
and then there's the thing you've got green blood
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Little"><B>Little</B></A>
A record box outside my door<BR>
coming home really late from work once more<BR>
and it made my day<BR>
such a little thing<BR>
It's the thought that counts<BR>
and the hope it brings
<P>
A little further<BR>
A little bit longer<BR>
A little package is more condensed<BR>
the little things make a big difference
<P>
I tried to carry you home from the bar<BR>
but I'm out of shape and it's a little too far<BR>
So far to go, so far apart<BR>
So far so good, and auspicious start
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Believe"><B>Believe</B></A><BR>
Could you believe anything was wrong in the world<BR>
on a night like tonight<BR>
Keep the beat up fast and everything's fine<BR>
and the crowd reflects a shining light
<P>
Telling me that I've done something right for once<BR>
Telling me that I mean something to someone<BR>
and I wish there was a way to say<BR>
just how much this means to me
<P>
This is the way that I had dreamed<BR>
I can't believe that this is me
<P>
Me, and 10 years gone<BR>
and this scene will not be replayed<BR>
your patient ears through all the shows we've played<BR>
the past four years, leave a debt unpaid
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Escalator"><B>Escalator</B></A><BR>
It's a point of view problem<BR>
you've got no sense of distortion<BR>
I'm always right, you're never wrong<BR>
it gets blown out of proportion<BR>
maybe no one's right<BR>
but it's always worth a fight<BR>
and another win would sure help my extortion
<P>
Looks like I won again<BR>
I can't believe what you just said<BR>
I'll let you do the math<BR>
if you can do it in your head<BR>
darlin' you can't add<BR>
and your subtraction skills are sad<BR>
so let's call it even and start over instead
<P>
Sinking self confidence, ego deflater<BR>
why do we bother with it escalater<BR>
Waiting around for the crowd to disperse<BR>
the longer it drags just gets worse and worse
<P>
It's all over now<BR>
shaking like an oscillator<BR>
so many battles lost and won<BR>
that we need a calculator<BR>
Nobody won the war<BR>
now what were we fighting for<BR>
got lost in all the convoluted roar
<P>
Escalater see you later when you stop smoking out your ears<BR>
evaporation cools you down<BR>
some day you're gonna blow you've been smoldering for years<BR>
no one ever comes around anymore
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Inland"><B>The Inland Empire Strikes Back</B></A><BR>
Woke up today thinking about my hometown<BR>
thought about going back to see who's hanging around<BR>
remember back when we didn't have a clue<BR>
and how we used to sit and whine that there was nothing to do
<P>
Way too young to understand<BR>
you've got to make it what you want<BR>
part of me is still Spokane<BR>
that's never gotten off the track<BR>
just waiting for The Inland Empire Strikes Back<BR>
<P>
Mna Mna, Vampire Lezbos, and T.F.L.<BR>
whatever happened to those clowns<BR>
I think they ended up in jail<BR>
But there's no shortage of bands to get drunk for<BR>
There'll always be the Fumes and Flies kicking out Spokanimalcore
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Computer"><B>Computer Geek</B></A><BR>
The time has come to talk about the place I work<BR>
my name's Ean and I'm a computer dork<BR>
I'm not as smart as Jon Von Zelowitz<BR>
but I have a good time playing this techno weenie gig
<P>
I answer questions that come as phone calls<BR>
features, drivers, upgrades and net installs<BR>
and once I had to despite my total shock<BR>
tell some guy just how to use a number lock<BR>
he didn't know how to use a number lock
<P>
We're a bunch of computer dorks<BR>
and that's the way we wanna be<BR>
just having fun but getting paid for work<BR>
I must be a computer geek
<P>
We go home and play on the internet<BR>
email, ftp, and the world wide web<BR>
Friday night I hang out with all my friends<BR>
We go surfin' out on the internet<BR>
you'll find me surfin' out on the internet
<P>
<A NAME="Fields"><B>Fields</B></A><BR>
August night swelters roll back the covers<BR>
and I remember a long lost summer<BR>
when you and I were a whole lot better friends
<P>
In skyclad fields we came together<BR>
hard to hold in moonlit heather<BR>
get off me boy, you're breaking my back again
<P>
And a mouth full of broken words<BR>
was all I had and all she heard<BR>
as the sun set down to disappear<BR>
into the haziest sunset of the year
<P>
So we drove for days and talked about nothing<BR>
as the fields rolled by an American discussion<BR>
do you remember when
<P>
Do you recall the place that you're from<BR>
who do you like and who do you love<BR>
who do you hate and who's your favorite band
<P>
Isn't it weird how things can change<BR>
in a year and some you look so strange<BR>
and you don't look at me half as dear<BR>
as you did sometime late last year...goodbye
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Dole"><B>On the Dole</B></A><BR>
My work ethic's been destroyed<BR>
and I'm glad I'm unemployed<BR>
I'm always broke so what's been gained<BR>
thank God for the government<BR>
stuck to the cough like rubber cement<BR>
FX Channel keeps me entertained
<P>
I'm on the dole, out of control<BR>
I wonder if they're on to me<BR>
and I'm in the hole, but I'm on the dole<BR>
and all I do is watch T.V.
<P>
I never leave the house<BR>
Woodsy thinks I'm part of the couch<BR>
the difference has become unclear<BR>
When she's gone I play musical chairs<BR>
while Robin's getting high upstairs<BR>
I can hear her hacking from here
<P>
My employer left me in the lurch<BR>
have you made an active work search<BR>
these claim forms are getting hard<BR>
can't afford to let down my guard<BR>
and all this time to kill<BR>
hangs over me like unpaid bills<BR>
waiting for the day that I can pay<BR>
and you bet I will
<P>
I'm on the dole, but I'm in control<BR>
and all I do is watch T.V. and wonder if they're on to me<BR>
I'm in the hole, but I'm on the dole<BR>
Imagine all the time to kill<BR>
I'm sure you can, I know I will
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Bad"><B>Bad Situation</B></A><BR>
Kind of a boy and kind of a girl<BR>
I drink drink drink drink drink until<BR>
I'm finding myself alone for a while<BR>
when the most I've got is a half eaten smile
<P>
I know that Speed Stick causes cancer but<BR>
you see there's seeds of hope in a cigarette butt<BR>
I'll drink and drink and think some more<BR>
'till I hang us both, maybe or...
<P>
try to make the best of a bad situation<BR>
try to make the best of a bad situation<BR>
your taxes mow your lawns in your old age contagion<BR>
but I try to make the best of a bad situation
<P>
A beautiful girl she twist her hair<BR>
I break my neck falling down stairs<BR>
I thought a lot about the world around <BR>
'cause when I thought about myself<BR>
it brought me down
<P>
There's a name for you on a bottle of bourbon<BR>
There's a name for you on a bottle of gin<BR>
There's space for you in a bottle of bourbon<BR>
is there room for me can you let me in
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Breakfast"><B>The Breakfast Song (LIVE)</B></A><BR>
When you're playing in a rock and roll band<BR>
you gotta eat eggs for breakfast every time you can<BR>
'cause they got lots of protein and cholesterol<BR>
they'll get you up and going and that's not all
<P>
Captain Crunch he's really really neat<BR>
he's got a red hat and two blue feet<BR>
he sails in a ship around the world<BR>
I hope he finds a crunch berry girl<BR>
in the Breakfast Song
<P>
Dinner is cool and lunch is neat<BR>
but a hearty breakfast just can't be beat<BR>
eggs and juice and cereal<BR>
toast and cheese all in a bowl<BR>
in the Breakfast Song
<P>
<A NAME="Rainy"><B>Rainy Day Song</B></A> <I>(Japanese CD Only)</I><BR>
Sometimes I recall nothing at all<BR>
but the patter pelt sounds of rain coming down<BR>
on the windows outside of my parents' house<BR>
when I was a boy in a rainy port town
<P>
And you know that it's true <BR>
when I was walking from school in the rain <BR>
and I was maybe 7 or 8<BR>
I splashed in the puddles and played with wet dogs<BR>
chased ducks, hide and seek in the fog
<P>
And I know those days are gone
<P>
And you know that my mom<BR>
she said take off your shoes at the door<BR>
you'll have wet dogs and puddles no more<BR>
you'll bathe and put on a clean change of clothes<BR>
I'm sure that you'll catch your death of cold
<P>
but then I didn't die
<P>
so it came to be <BR>
that I was supposed to keep my feet clean <BR>
and dry when rainy days coming were seen<BR>
mom said you'll walk straight to school and then<BR>
you'll walk straight home after again
<P>
but some things you can't deny
<P>
so even today<BR>
when I'm walking around in the rain<BR>
and I've got somewhere warm to stay<BR>
I'll splash in the puddles and play with wet dogs<BR>
chase ducks play hide and seek in the fog
<P>
and those days will never die
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="80"><B>80 Dollars</B></A> (Japanese CD Only)<BR>
No one seems to understand<BR>
why junk just sort of finds this band<BR>
it's high time we realize<BR>
let it come as no surprise<BR>
nothing ever goes our way<BR>
I'm losing hope today
<P>
God he must've been disappointed<BR>
never seen him so disjointed<BR>
It cost me 80 dollars
<P>
We really aren't that fucking dense<BR>
I swear to God we've got some sense<BR>
it ain't exactly shining through<BR>
Ean's face is turning blue<BR>
I wish this thing would work<BR>
you're gonna lose that smirk
