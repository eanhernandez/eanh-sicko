<A NAME="Half"><B>Wave Motion Gun</B></A><BR>
You had a year<BR>
now there's 12 days left to save the Earth<BR>
let's get out of here<BR>
and we're stuck out in space in a battleship
<P>
Derek Wildstar where are you<BR>
we've got some work for you to do<BR>
there's no time to fuck around<BR>
save it 'till you're back here on the ground<BR>
<P>
And you better buckle down<BR>
the Comet Empire's closing in<BR>
and you better hurry back<BR>
before they attack again<BR>
you're our only hope<BR>
since the damage has begun<BR>
you and that goddamn wave motion gun<BR>
<P>
The Gamilons raging full on<BR>
have turned the Earth into a mess<BR>
your brother's dead your family's gone<BR>
who are you trying to impress
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="FarmSong"><B>Farm Song</B></A><BR>
Hey I heard you got back today<BR>
everybody's got something to say<BR>
how did it go and where have you gone<BR>
Oo come on come on
<P>
Well it's not that great<BR>
and it's not that fun<BR>
it's just a bunch of bored kids<BR>
acting really dumb<BR>
it's not the life for everyone/anyone
<P>
Oo I heard it got back from you<BR>
everybody's got nothing to do<BR>
I wanna play rock but nobody's home<BR>
Oo come on come on
<P>
Hey I heard you got back today<BR>
everybody's got something to say<BR>
I wanna play rock but nobody's home<BR>
Oo come on come on
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="When"><B>When to Quit</B></A><BR>
Once upon a time<BR>
it was much better than today<BR>
when did it become a crime <BR>
to know exactly what to say<BR>
And you say that's how it goes<BR>
things get old and rust like tin<BR>
now I'm stuck outside your inside jokes<BR>
please don't let me in
<P>
And I want more out of life than stupid jokes<BR>
come on pal, tell me now <BR>
exactly where to go<BR>
and I think it's about time that you admit<BR>
you don't know when to quit
<P>
Listen to the sound <BR>
of me telling you you're wrong<BR>
drove it into the ground<BR>
and drug it out for far too long
<P>
And you can deny it's true<BR>
and ignore the subtle clues<BR>
but I don't know what I'd do<BR>
without the stupid things I do
<P>
So fucked 'cause I don't know either<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Johnny"><B>Johnny Be Not So Good</B></A><BR>
Meghan says I've got a brand new toy<BR>
something to watch<BR>
and something you'll enjoy<BR>
a woman you've never seen<BR>
and a man that you know<BR>
grainy video tapes <BR>
of an old time rock and roller
<P>
And when he dies they'll talk about him<BR>
saying he was a very bad man<BR>
and if you stop to think about it<BR>
what would you say...he's a very bad man
<P>
I've always known that folks did stuff like this<BR>
but watching Johnny not be so good<BR>
kind of made me sick<BR>
after meeting a hundred punkers<BR>
who thought it was a gas<BR>
I'm starting to think he's funny<BR>
and his kinks they make me laugh
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Bad"><B>Bad Year</B></A><BR>
I don't need this anymore<BR>
the curse of '94 strikes again<BR>
killing hopes and things and people<BR>
stop, stop you're killing me<BR>
and I tried so desperately to escape it<BR>
suck days ahead I think I'll stay in bed<BR>
Life's the same <BR>
I guess everything's going okay<BR>
I've got to go now<BR>
I've run out of cute things to say<BR>
I don't mean to sound so insincere<BR>
I'm having a bad year
<P>
And I'm glad to say goodbye<BR>
but I'll never wonder why this year happened<BR>
luck comes and goes sooner or later<BR>
wait, wait for it to stop<BR>
'cause I'm not just gonna drop out of being<BR>
for one bad year that was just leaving
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Rehashed"><B>Rehashed</B></A><BR>
Feel I should apologize<BR>
is it pretentious in your eyes<BR>
to think you want to hear our band<BR>
hope you care or even understand
<P>
And you can throw it out if there is no doubt<BR>
you've heard this song before<BR>
I'm not gonna care about it anymore
<P>
If there's nothing new<BR>
can I copy you<BR>
steal a song or two <BR>
borrowed line here and there<BR>
they were never mine why should I care<BR>
and if it's all been done<BR>
then we're on our way<BR>
with a bullet straight to number one<BR>
'cause we stole the hits<BR>
we may not be artists but at least we're not
<P>
Dumb old songs that we abused<BR>
ignorance is such a lame excuse<BR>
but I didn't know what I'd got into<BR>
I was only 12 and it seemed like the thing to do
<P>
That's all it was<BR>
nothing more than something fun to do<BR>
I'm sorry if you're disappointed in the truth
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Snowcone"><B>Snowcone</B></A><BR>
While the snow comes down at Rachel's house<BR>
watching big time wrestling videos<BR>
I said, "are these guys really doing this?"<BR>
she asked me was I serious
<P>
And would you like to have a beer<BR>
or a glass of hot tea<BR>
we'll talk about life<BR>
while we're watching T.V.<BR>
And it gets cold...
<P>
While the snow comes down at Rachel's house<BR>
and the cat keeps trying to get out<BR>
because the mice are playing out in the yard<BR>
and keeping kitty cat cool is getting hard

While the snow comes down at Rachel's house<BR>
and the view outside it leaves no doubt<BR>
that driving home is going to be rough<BR>
with all that snow and ice and stuff
<P>
And so we say, "good night, good night,<BR>
I can drive, I'll be alright"<BR>
I stepped into a snowy night<BR>
turn around, my arms held wide, I drove home
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Little"><B>Little Star</B></A><BR>
You shine brightly in my sky<BR>
with me while the nights go by<BR>
catch a comet by the tail<BR>
if he hollers go to jail
<P>
I had a spider monkey and his name was Bob<BR>
he had a nice smile and I liked him a lot<BR>
but he was nothing next to you <BR>
'cause you're my little star and you shine through<BR>
<P>
You're my little star<BR>
my star, my little star
<P>
Thunder, lightning, sunshine, rain<BR>
when will I to see you again<BR>
(It should be "when will we two meet again"<BR>
but Ean blew it)<BR>
find a little lovers' lair<BR>
name the time and I'll be there
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Juice"><B>The Juice is Loose</B></A><BR>
Do you read me<BR>
this is headquarters <BR>
and soon you'll be free<BR>
we got commandos on the way<BR>
so just sit tight, OJ
<P>
Sitting around Sunday morning<BR>
thinking how lame it is<BR>
the Juice is stuck in jail<BR>
when he's obviously innocent<BR>
we've got choppers and uzis<BR>
and a hit new theme song<BR>
LA county jail can't be that strong<BR>
Choppers on the roof<BR>
and commandos down the hall<BR>
OJ's private jailers up against the wall<BR>
a laser to cut the bars<BR>
and hand the Juice a gun<BR>
stand back boys <BR>
and watch THE MAN run
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Who"><B>Who Owes</B></A><BR>
When I heard he was accused<BR>
read the story in the news <BR>
and I said it was a lie<BR>
He's not the kind of person to <BR>
but then again neither are you<BR>
I know the what where when and how<BR>
but why...and who owes who<BR>
<P>
All these years that I thought<BR>
you owed me one<BR>
now the memory of it all<BR>
suddenly changed<BR>
as if that was not enough<BR>
wonder if I remind you of<BR>
and exactly who it was<BR>
that was estranged
<P>
Then you left, disappeared<BR>
from the memories you feared<BR>
escape is what you chose<BR>
and all I want to know is who owes
<P>
Never knew, yeah, I didn't have a clue<BR>
no surprise look at the size<BR>
of my little world<BR>
but you never said a thing<BR>
or I wasn't listening<BR>
I don't have time to pay attention to a girl
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="Mom"><B>Mom</B></A><BR>
She's got eyes in the back of her head<BR>
and while you'll never find a page<BR>
of the books she hasn't read<BR>
she says she's got her eyes on me<BR>
knows what I'm going to be
<P>
She's my mother, bore my brother<BR>
I am her son<BR>
Love thy mother like no other<BR>
bear the weight of the son
<P>
She's got a slice of the half moon<BR>
caught in her eye
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="What"><B>What's On</B></A> <I>(Note: This song features Josh on Bass and Ean on Drums)</I><BR>
It's a crystal clear defining point<BR>
when I'm out of here<BR>
and you're out of joint<BR>
and it's gotten way off track<BR>
so far it's never coming back<BR>
and no markers here to compensate<BR>
for the way the trail just dissipates
<P>
And I go to sleep<BR>
when you want to talk<BR>
if I don't compare I'll just sit and stare<BR>
when you strip everything away<BR>
and all you see is what's on<BR>
and what you see is what you get
<P>
Find it hard to believe<BR>
what you're sure is real<BR>
and can you describe the way you feel<BR>
exactly at this time<BR>
pin the tail, turn it on a dime<BR>
do you love the strong and silent boys<BR>
keep to themselves <BR>
selfish with their toys
<P>
And although I know<BR>
that's not what you planned<BR>
what's so hard to understand<BR>
when you strip everything away<BR>
and all you see is what's on T.V.
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Weasel of Doom/Lady '95</B></A><BR>
He'll get in your BRAIN<BR>
he'll drive you INSANE<BR>
you'll feel the DISDAIN<BR>
you know it's a SHAME<BR>
the weasel is CAIN.
<P>
The weasel, he'll get into YOU<BR>
he'll tear you in TWO<BR>
the weasel will DO<BR>
the weasel...<BR>
the weasel is YOU.
<P>
Weasel of DOOM<BR>
he's coming for YOU<BR>
nothing you can DO<BR>
the weasel of DOOM.
<P>
Fear the CONFUSION<BR>
you'll get a CONTUSION<BR>
it's nuclear FUSION<BR>
it's just an ILLUSION<BR>
it's just hard to say...
<P>
The weasel will drive you INSANE<BR>
he'll get in your BRAIN<BR>
he'll bring you some PAIN<BR>
the weasel...<BR>
the weasel does COCAINE.
<P>
The weasel of DOOM<BR>
he's coming for YOU<BR>
nothing you can DO<BR>
the weasel of DOOM. (ad nauseam)
<P>
yaya yaya yaayaa.......just don't drink<BR>
