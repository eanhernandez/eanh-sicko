It began, like many things, with a sperm and an egg. I spent most of formative years in Los Angeles, CA where my brother and I 
were regularly encouraged to find an interest in music. I tried the guitar, the violin and even the ukulele. Eventually I 
discovered the beauty of constructively hitting things with sticks. The first song I ever learned to play was "Another One 
Bites The Dust" by Queen. I started on a set of practice pads which my mother was nice enough to buy for me. Around age
thirteen I sold a dirt bike I had and bought an old Ludwig set...it cost me $550 and it was my life's savings. I had recently been 
turned on to Ozzy Osbourne and Van Halen and had decided that being a rock star was about as good as it could get. 
So, I quit taking lessons (Eddie Van Halen didn't need 'em either) and began playing through headphones with the baddest of the bad: 
Alex Van Halen, Tommy Lee, Niko McBrain. Eventually I got into a band called "Attack". We were about as good as any 
mid-teen metal band can be...complete with songs like, "The Storm Never Dies", "Too Late" and my personal favorite, "Under Attack" 
(it went nicely with the name). We played only a few shows, managing to come in last at a local battle of the bands competition. We
also made a tape which I now sheepishly pull out every once in a while.<BR>

The big change musically came around fifteen when my brother went to college and started sending back tapes he had made of 
punk bands...The Replacements, X, Husker Du, Butthole Surfers, Cringer, The Mr. T Experience...stuff like that. I decided quickly 
that punk rock was my future and spent the next few years learning to play faster. Eventually, after I had moved to Seattle to go to college, 
I played briefly in a grunge band called Hair Salad and a blues/rock band called The Gully. Eventually I was introducted to <A HREF="ean.htm">Ean</A> and <A HREF="denny.htm">Denny</A> through 
a mutual friend. They were about the only ones in Seattle at the time who didn't want to play music like Soundgarden. We hit it off immediately. 
Since then it's been 1-2-3-4.
