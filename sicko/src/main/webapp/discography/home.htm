Okay, so here lies the output of our band during the eight years we were together. Our first recording
was done in Ean's dank basement in the summer of 1991.  We did it on some Tascam machine 
which recorded directly to cassette. The quality was marginal, but we made a demo 
tape out of it. One of the cassettes and a bottle of scotch made its way (courtesy of Denny's
sister) to the house of the head of eMpTy Records, Blake Wright. Soon after, through some
weird twist of fate, we were in the studio with our guitar rock hero, Kurt Bloch, recording 
our first single for the eMpTy Records World Empire. True story. Since then it's more of the 
same as you'll see.
