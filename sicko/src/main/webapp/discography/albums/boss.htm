Ask me nicely to get lost<BR>
Wondered what you meant by that<BR>
But once the T's had all been crossed<BR>
I realized you've got no tact<BR>
Much to my dismay<BR>
There was nothing to assay<BR>
I think I'd have a shot at it if they'd just let me play<BR>
Tell me what I've been doing wrong<BR>
And you go on and on and all night long<BR>
And my window of opportunity<BR>
Was dangled right in front of me<BR>
Won't open up because it was painted shut</P>
<P>Baiting me with interest<BR>
Just so you can say so what<BR>
And somewhere there's a village<BR>
That's missing an idiot<BR>
Imagine my chagrin <BR>
Don't know where to begin<BR>
Got one foot stuck in the door I'm almost halfway in<BR>
Those traps had all been set before<BR>
And you walk on and on across the floor<BR>
And my window of opportunity<BR>
Was dangled right in front of me<BR>
Just wide enough but it was painted shut</P>
<P>Give it a chance<BR>
Try to be nice<BR>
Whether you mean it or not<BR>
I don't mind<BR>
If you don't find<BR>
The window 'cause someone drew the blind</P>
<P>There's nothing left to misconstrue<BR>
And you go on and on and right on cue<BR>
And my Window of opportunity<BR>
Dangled it right in front of me<BR>
Just wide enough but it was painted shut<BR>
Window of opportunity<BR>
Dangled it right in front of me<BR>
Just wide enough but it was painted shut <BR>

<A NAME="Rabbit"><B>A Song About A Rabbit</A></B><BR>
Good shot Peter<BR>
I hope you go far<BR>
cause there's a rabbit wearing coveralls playing in my front yard</P>
<P>you do the two step Peter<BR>
and you make it look good<BR>
cause there's a bear watching you from the edge of the hundred acre wood<BR>
(the bear, he said)</P>
<P>Peter</P>
<P>in a snow storm Peter<BR>
and two straight lines<BR>
holding hands yellow hat red hair her name was Madeline<BR>
(her name was Madeline)</P>
<P>Peter</P>
<P>I remember you Peter<BR>
and all of the rest<BR>
from the stories that a dreamy eyed baby boy loved the best</P>
<P>so in the moonlight Peter<BR>
where the wild things sleep<BR>
you and a boy in a wolf suit dancing by the side of the sea<BR>
(they said...) <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="MikeTV"><B>Mike TV</A></B><BR>
When he's asleep, when he's awake<BR>
Eating a Swanson's Salisbury Steak<BR>
He's glued to the TV<BR>
He knows the names he knows the plot<BR>
He likes it when they all get shot<BR>
A blaze of glory<BR>
Mike TV<BR>
Shot in front of a live audience<BR>
Mike TV<BR>
Owes it all to his parents<BR>
And that reminds me <BR>
Of something I saw on TV<BR>
Or was it some old movie<BR>
Life's just no fun it's all reruns</P>
<P>Hey look at me I'm on TV<BR>
I am whoever I want to be<BR>
I live vicariously<BR>
I figured it out <BR>
Cause I'm pretty smart<BR>
Fast forward through the boring parts<BR>
Action's all I see</P>
<P>Mike TV<BR>
Back after these messages<BR>
Mike TV<BR>
Back after these vestiges<BR>
And that reminds me<BR>
Of something I saw on TV<BR>
Or was it some old movie<BR>
Life's just no fun it's all rerun <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Indie"><B>An Indie Rock Daydream</A></B><BR>
Rock and roll Saturday night people watching me play<BR>
but we're playing at the YMCA<BR>
we've danced on stages from Spain to Tokyo<BR>
and we've slept on the floors of the world</P>
<P>these are the days that I will remember<BR>
these are the days that I will remember<BR>
the wide eyed moments of an indie rock daydream<BR>
soon enough, this'll all be gone</P>
<P>Pretty girl smiling at me, I'm smiling myself<BR>
but she's leaving with somebody else<BR>
I don't care if things never change<BR>
cause at this point success would seem strange</P>
<P>these are the days that I will remember<BR>
these are the days that I will remember<BR>
the wide eyed moments of an indie rock daydream<BR>
soon enough, this'll all be gone <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="One"><B>The One That Got Away</A></B><BR>
He grew up just down the street<BR>
Thought he was the biggest geek<BR>
And he played with his computer games<BR>
Guess you could've been the Mrs.<BR>
If you could stand the way he kisses<BR>
But you'd rather call him names</P>
<P>And he might jus be a billionaire<BR>
Or he might just go insane<BR>
Who's to say and who's the one that got away</P>
<P>Friday night it's getting late<BR>
Should you go on that blind date<BR>
And he seems like such a nice guy<BR>
Let's go walk down by the water<BR>
See the nice gifts that he bought her<BR>
I'm so thrilled I could die</P>
<P>And he might just be a psychopath<BR>
Or he might just make it big<BR>
Who's to say and who's the one that got away.</P>
<P>That's all to say, not much to do<BR>
Sometimes they go your way, sometimes they get away from you<BR>
And that's the point, you don't know how it ends<BR>
You have to follow little clues like signs that say "dead end"<BR>
He could be or you could be you'll have to stick around and see<BR>
The path it takes and who escapes <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Hipster"><B>Hipster Boyfriend</A></B><BR>
She's got a hipster boyfriend and he wears some black clunky shoes<BR>
and he likes to smoke American Spirit cigarettes<BR>
and he's got a gas station jacket that says his name is MOE<BR>
and he hangs out at all the Punk Punk Punk Punk Punk rock shows</P>
<P>hipster boyfriend hipster boyfriend she's got a hipster boyfriend<BR>
hipster boyfriend hipster boyfriend she's got a hipster boyfriend<BR>
and she loves him so...</P>
<P>she's got a hipster boyfriend and he drives a white dodge dart<BR>
when they go out shopping at thrift stores<BR>
and they wear *"slanted plastic glasses" when it's bright<BR>
and they're gonna go home and read Gearhead tonight</P>

<A NAME="Attention"><B>Attention Please</A></B><BR>
Your attention please I've got something to share<BR>
So feast your eyes upon my brand new hair <BR>
If your eyes can adjust<BR>
To the neon glare and my look of disgust</P>
<P>What are you seeking validation for<BR>
At the character assassination store<BR>
Their shelves are full but nothing's cheap</P>
<P>So pick your ego up of the floor<BR>
And inch or two but nothing more<BR>
It's a crutch you want not what you got<BR>
You're falling all over the looks you bought</P>
<P>The best are brought down by degrees<BR>
The rest are curiosities<BR>
Attention please! is all they understand</P>
<P>Drawing a crowd for some meager pay<BR>
Drawing a bead down on the weakly pray<BR>
Got to throw in your hat<BR>
Win, lose or draw you're a diplomat</P>
<P>You pull the act out on demand<BR>
And always have the upper hand<BR>
Be prepared for reprimand<BR>
Attention's all they understand</P>
<P>The best are brought down by degrees<BR>
Or killed by curiosities<BR>
Attention please! is all they understand <BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="Warewolf"><B>My Tribute To The Misfits<BR>
&nbsp;(aka: Your Sister Is A Werewolf Tonight)</A></B><BR>
your sister...</P>
<P>She got bit by another werewolf<BR>
she was on the news at five<BR>
she got shot by a silver bullet<BR>
she got buried alive</P>
<P>she walked down a darkened alley<BR>
she looked up and saw the moon<BR>
she looked down and her hands were hairy<BR>
she knew she'd be killing soon</P>
<P>your sister...</P>
<P>she was your baby sister<BR>
she was so beautiful<BR>
she went out with her werewolf boyfriend<BR>
now she's got her teeth in you</P>
<P>she got shot by her own father<BR>
she got shot on devil's night<BR>
he blew her brains out <BR>
then she scooped them up<BR>
she said<BR>
let me give you a piece of my mind</P>
<P>your sister... <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Washington"><B>Washington My Home</A></B><BR>
Washington my home<BR>
wherever I may roam<BR>
you are my land <BR>
my native land<BR>
Washington my home<BR>
your verdant forests green<BR>
caressed by silvery streams<BR>
with nests of pines and brandied wines<BR>
Washington my home</P>
<P>there’s a peace you feel and understand<BR>
in this our own beloved land<BR>
we’ll greet the day with head held high<BR>
and forward ever is our cry</P>
<P>we’ll happy ever be<BR>
as people always free<BR>
for you and me a destiny<BR>
Washington my home <BR>

<BR>
<A NAME="Happened"><B>What Happened</A></B><BR>
the other day I put on a record<BR>
that I was into when I was 21<BR>
thought of the bands we used to listen to<BR>
wondered where they all had gone</P>
<P>Dinosaur Jr what happened to you?<BR>
the Lemonheads turned into a Tiger Beat band<BR>
Soul Asylum are rock stars now</P>
<P>but the feeling is gone</P>
<P>the other day I went to the record store<BR>
that I loved in 1991<BR>
in a stupid sea of compact disks<BR>
I found out all the records were gone</P>
<P>Dinosaur Jr what happened to you?<BR>
the Lemonheads turned into a Tiger Beat band<BR>
Soul Asylum are rock stars now</P>
<P>but the feeling is gone <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="High"><B>High Hopes</A></B><BR>
Billed to be the best night of the year<BR>
The stage is set, the coast is clear<BR>
Remember last year when the car broke down<BR>
Stranded on the other side of town<BR>
The sun came up we pushed the Dart to the station by the park<BR>
They start selling again at six<BR>
Mechanic got an early start, while we waited for the part<BR>
We sat and drank ourselves sick</P>
<P>Clouded up and the snow came down all day<BR>
Tonight the shows at least an hour's drive away<BR>
I propose this time we take my car<BR>
Can't miss it, it will be the best by far<BR>
The party came and went, the carpet's soaked, the keg is spent<BR>
And there's a ringing in my ears<BR>
Everyone said it was the best you and I cannot attest<BR>
I guess we had more fun last year </P>
<P>The sun came up and it's shining in my eyes<BR>
Managed to miss the best night of our lives<BR>
Walk through the snow until you feel the sting<BR>
Big expectations and high hopes can bring</P>
<P>Why do you insist to build up everything<BR>
The best thing ever don't exist<BR>
It's got a certain ring<BR>
Why do you insist to build up everything<BR>
The best thing ever don't exist <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Words"><B>In So Many Words</A></B><BR>
This song doesn't have any words...that's the funny part. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Vacant"><B>If I'm Vacant</A></B><BR>
You could scream and scream and scream at me <BR>
for years on end<BR>
and never collide<BR>
cause it's all good<BR>
if it's understood<BR>
that all your rage just makes me hide</P>
<P>if I'm vacant<BR>
figure it out<BR>
if I'm vacant<BR>
I shut down when you start screaming</P>
<P>and do what you want to do<BR>
say what you want to say<BR>
I don't care if you scream at me<BR>
it's all good if it's under stood<BR>
that I don't hear you when you scream at me</P>
<P>if I'm vacant<BR>
figure it out<BR>
if I'm vacant<BR>
I shut down when you start screaming</P>
<P>You could scream and scream and scream at me <BR>
for years on end<BR>
and never collide<BR>
cause it's all good<BR>
if it's understood<BR>
that I don't even hear your side<BR>
and do what you want to do<BR>
say what you want to say to me <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Summer"><B>Summer Never Came</A></B><BR>
We come from towns where the sun beats down <BR>
And the air is filled with dust<BR>
In the winter windows crack from cold<BR>
And the Spring rains bring the rust<BR>
The changes seemed so natural<BR>
They were never thought about<BR>
'til we moved out to the coast<BR>
And we had to do without</P>
<P>I heard a little voice that called my name<BR>
And now the seasons seem to never change</P>
<P>The way she looked at me with all sincerity<BR>
And asked me when the rain was gonna stop<BR>
Next week for sure I vowed, then I had to laugh out loud<BR>
'cause I couldn't fake the attitude I'd copped</P>
<P>Sometimes I get depressed<BR>
And I want to move away<BR>
When the days are long and cold<BR>
And everything is gray<BR>
Then I think of how the dust would blow<BR>
And how I hate to drive in snow<BR>
And everything seems better then <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Yakuri"><B>Yakuri Abe</A></B><BR>
Yakuri Abe plays guitar in a pop punk band<BR>

<P>she's a punker she's Hana she's a girl with almond eyes from a faraway land...</P>
<P>Yakuri Abe brought Godzilla dolls for a rock and roll band<BR>
Yakuri Abe said something to me that I don't understand</P>
<P>she's a punker she's Hana she's a girl with almond eyes from a faraway land...</P>
<P>Yakuri Abe walks the rain soaked streets of Shibuya Ku<BR>
Yakuri Abe did you ever know that it rains here too?</P>
<P>she's a punker she's Hana she's a girl with almond eyes from a faraway land... <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Best"><B>The Best Thing In The World</A></B><BR>
playing in this bad pop band<BR>
was the best thing that I ever did<BR>
playing in a punk rock band<BR>
was a lot more fun than anybody ever said</P>
<P>the best thing in the world<BR>
doing what you want to do</P>
<P>the skinheads frat boys and crusty punks<BR>
the heavy metal soundmen and stupid drunks<BR>
all conspire to drive me away<BR>
but they can't compete with my desire to play</P>
<P>the best thing in the world<BR>
doing what you want to do <BR>
