<FONT SIZE=3><B>What's New</B></FONT> by Ean<BR> 
This is the first edition of the Sicko newsletter.
We put this together to keep people posted on 
what's coming up for Sicko and what stupid new 
self promotional stunts we're currently perpetrating.
<P>
The story begins in February, when we headed into 
the studio with Kurt Bloch to record "Laugh While 
You Can, Monkey Boy", and laid down 13 tracks in 2
days.  Denny's sister Jill put together the artwork,
and the fine product was released on June 10th with
a super cool kick off party at the Crocodile cafe in 
lovely downtown Seattle.  Northwest superstars Glazed, 
The Model Rockets and Cub opened up for us.  What a 
cool night! We gave away 80 free drink tickets and 
played to one of the most enthusiastic Sicko crowds 
ever. We wore dark retro skinny tie suits looking VERY 
sharp, I might add...Vincent Vega would have been very 
impressed.  
<P>
Midsummer saw us driving down the coast of California 
again, but for once, in a rental van.  Ohmygod!What 
luxury! This machine had cruise control, air conditioning 
AND a stereo! This was extremely cool when driving through 
the 104 degree heat wave that was Sacramento. Josh and I 
had a great time learning to switch drivers while travelling 
at 80 m.p.h. on cruise control through LA. Denny was asleep 
for these hi-jinx, but I'm sure he was enduring awful nightmares. 
The highlight of the tour was hanging out in San Diego all day, 
driving up to LA to play a show at the Jabberjaw with indie rockers 
Chinchilla and Knapsack, loading out at 1 AM and driving straight 
home to Seattle.  The trip takes about 17 hours, and we did it 
by sleeping in shifts and drinking record breaking amounts of 
coffee. Josh and I entertained ourselves for about 3 hours by 
harassing a yuppie driver guy in a Lexus... he would keep pulling 
up behind people, honk at them and motion with his thumb, yelling 
"move over! move over!", so he could pass them. We thought this 
was rude, so we chased him the whole way across Oregon, Beastie 
Boys blasting on the stereo,  dark glasses on, synchronizing our 
four thumbs in various gestures yelling "move over! move over!".  
We also would pass this guy and make our Mecha Ghidora monster 
doll growl and shake his wings at him...I added some unique 
facial expressions for effect. This guy at first was so 
shocked that he just stared in disbelief, but after the 10th 
of 12th passing with Mecha Ghidora in full effect, he was 
screaming "fuck you!" at us.  
<P>
What a great drive.  We made it home alive (mercifully) and 
headed right back into the studio to record our next record, 
"Chef Boy R U Dum", again with Kurt.  The session went pretty 
well,  we got a bunch of cool new songs, and a new appreciation 
for Ritchie Blackmoore, as Kurt brought in his Deep Purple rockumentary 
video tape. In fact, Ritchie makes an appearance on the record, saying 
a few words of wisdom just before it starts, and just after 
it ends.  Things have been pretty mellow for Sicko since this 
time,  we've just been practicing and planning our next tour... 
slated for this spring.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Essential Activities For The Budding...</B></FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Dateless Losers' Club</B></FONT> by Josh<BR>
It can be a depressing time; no one to call your own, feelings of 
loneliness, blah blah blah. That's why you need good, semi-constructive 
activities to occupy your time. First on your list should be to establish 
a Dateless Losers' Club. This isn't really hard; chances are you have 
many friends who are unable to maintain lasting relationships and are 
continually drifting in and out of dateless loserdom. Pick a core of 
people and then ORGANIZE. Noam Chomsky said it best, "Being alone you 
can't do anything. All you can do is deplore the situation. But if 
you join with other people, you can make changes." (Secrets, Lies and 
Democracy, p.105-106, 1994) The following is a list of activities for 
your budding Datless Losers' Club:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Talking Shit:  in establishing a Club of any kind, group cohesion is 
essential.  A good place to establish it for your Dateless Losers' Club 
is in the area of Ex-'s.  The feeling of bitterness about the breakup of 
the last relationship will be something all of you can relate to.  It's 
best to get the insults flying early in your first meeting as it facilitates 
activity number two.
<P>
<LI>Drinking:  being drunk is good for a number of reasons.  It lowers 
inhibitions which leads to lively exchanges of ideas,  it gives you something 
to do with your hands, and it gives you that false sense of self esteem.  
Something which has no doubt been damaged by the lack of someone else telling 
you you're OK.  
<P>
<LI>TV:  essential - negates the need for a real conversation between the 
members of your club - your focus can be the TV.  Being drunk and yelling 
insults at the television (maybe even relating the insults to your past 
relationships) is a good start.  
<P>
<LI>Fieldtrips: once the club has been formed and some sense of identity 
has been established, it's often a good idea to plan trips to local watering 
holes.  This is important, especially in the early years of your club as 
drinking must be maintained and there's usually a TV to watch.  It also 
gets you out of the house.  This adds to that false sense of self esteem. 
It is possible to move on to things like movies and trips to the Zoo for 
more advanced Dateless Losers' Clubs.  Try these techniques out and let 
us know how you're doing, we love to hear how the chapters of the Dateless 
Losers' Club are expanding and improving.  We'll print suggestions of new 
things for our clubs to do if you send them to us.  Good luck!
</OL>

If you'd like to join the Dateless Losers' Club national chapter, or officially 
register your own chapter of the Dateless Losers' Club, send a self addressed, 
stamped envelope to: The Dateless Losers' Club, PO Box 12034, Seattle, WA 98102.  
We'll send you future copies of our official newsletter, your official dateless 
losers' card, stickers and other goofy stuff.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>New Record And New Tour Planned</B></FONT> by Ean<BR>
Sicko released a new record October 20th called "Chef Boy Are You Dumb".  
This is a full length, 17 song release.  Art was provided by Pablo Griggs, 
who also drew the 13 Soda Punx cover art.  CD's are being put out in the 
US by Empty Records.  A Japanese import version is available from Real Cool 
Records in Japan and comes complete with lyrics translated into Japanese!  
A vinyl version was released by our pals in Spain, Munster Records, who also 
did the vinyl versions of Laugh While You Can, Monkey Boy, and the 13 Soda 
Punx  records. The vinyl version of Chef Boy R U Dumb is currently available 
from Empty by mail order, and in stores across the country.  This release will 
be followed up by a tour of megalithic proportions... 6 weeks across the US, 
coast to coast.  More than likely, we're coming to your town, so if you want 
to find out exactly when and where we're playing, or want to book us a show, 
just call Robin at Lobotomy Talent Group.  Her phone number and email address 
are at the end of this newsletter.  We will also be releasing a video, directed

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Jobless Loser Tips</B></FONT> by Denny<BR>
So here's my stupid column, a few weeks late and a few hundred words short.  
For six months this year I was living on unemployment and since you make 
barely enough money to survive you have to learn to enjoy doing nothing.    
Of course, this causes all sorts of problems when the money runs out.  
It can be pretty hard to look for a job when the only thing you've looked 
for in the last six months is a better show to watch.  And then when or if 
you actually find a job, you just don't seem to have the time to get anything 
else done.  With that warning against getting hooked on unemployment, I will 
now give you tips on getting by on it. The first thing you need to do is 
develop a bad T.V. habit.  You've got to learn to appreciate shows like 
Matlock and In the Heat of the Night.  They may not be very good but they're 
always on.  The next and basically only thing you can do is learn how to cook.  
You gotta eat, right, and since you can't afford to go to restaurants anymore 
you might as well learn to make your favorite foods at home.  Since almost 
everybody loves pizza, that's what I'm gonna start you out on.
<P>
First off you take one package of yeast and add it to 1 cup of warm water 
and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Mix it well and then let it sit for 10 minutes 
until it foams.  Then you add 1« cups unbleached flour and mix that well.  
Now add 2 tablespoons Olive Oil and 1 teaspoon Salt and mix well. Finally 
add 1 more cup of flour a little bit at a time until the dough stops sticking 
to the bowl, at which point you dump it out on the table and start turning it 
inside out and adding flour until the whole thing isn't sticky anymore.  Now 
cover it with a dish towel and move on to the other ingredients.  You'll 
probably want to start heating the oven up to 500ø while you do the rest of 
this.  I got the basic idea for this sauce from my roommate who used to work 
at Atlantic Street Pizza (best in Seattle) but she had no exact measurements 
for me so do it to taste.  Start with a can of tomato paste and add some 
cooking sherry, worcestshire sauce, ground cayenne, and paprika and mix it 
up.  Mince a few cloves of garlic but wait and sprinkle it on top of the sauce 
after you've spread it on the dough.  Now you can grate some mozzarella and 
cut up any toppings you plan to put on the pizza.  I always use cheap cheese 
because it's all gonna taste the same after being in a 500ø oven for 10 minutes.  
If you're gonna put any vegetables on your pizza, I'd suggest sauteing them in 
olive oil first or all the water will come out on top of your pizza.  And 
for god's sake buy pre sliced pepperoni because cutting your own ain't worth 
the trouble.
<P>
Now it's time to put it all together.  If you want thin crust cut the dough 
in half and put  half in the fridge.  Take the other half and smash it flat 
and either flip it or roll it out.  I can't flip so I roll.  If you don't 
have a rolling pin use a wine bottle or an empty 40oz* and roll it to whatever 
size pan you're using.  It makes a good 12" diameter pizza.  Lightly spread some 
oil on the baking sheet and put the rolled dough on it.  Spread however much 
tomato paste mixture on it you want and sprinkle the garlic and whatever herbs 
you want (oregano and basil are good). Put the cheese on top of that and whatever 
the hell else you want on it. That's it. Put it in the oven and bake it up.  
If you've got any questions feel free to write.  Next time will be vegetarian 
chili so stay tuned.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Terrible True Tales of Tour:<BR>
The Legend of the Red Mouth</B></FONT> by G. Money<BR> 
The following is a true story. The names have been changed to  protect the 
not so innocent. On a hot and steamy day in June Sicko played a club in a 
Midwest  town.  I was on tour with them as a photographer/roadie/mechanic 
and  all-around grunt boy.  I got paid in beer and free food.  It was hell. 
In an unnamed Midwest town we stayed at the house of a larger  than average 
girl who was into the dominance side of S&M.  This info  was provided to at 
no extra charge and without our asking.  It scared  us all pretty bad.  I 
slept with Josh in the van that night. She had a friend named Cindy who met 
all of us prior to the show  and said she'd be there.  At the show I got 
drunk, the band got drunk,  Cindy got drunk.  The band played. I took pictures.  
All was normal.   Later, following the show and more beer-for-all, Cindy got 
really  friendly with me (touchy friendly, if you know what I mean).  She told  
me that WE had been great, and did I have fun playing tonight?  HUH?   She 
thought I was in the band!  How drunk was this girl?  Drunk enough  to want 
to get her hands on a member of Sicko (PRETTY FUCKING DRUNK). And drunk enough 
to not know she was settling for the roadie. So soon she was smearing her very 
red lipstick on my mouth and  neck, etc.  Things didn't go any further than 
that (a relief I assure  you).  And though she said she would drive to unnamed 
Midwest town #2  to see US play the next day I never saw her again.  That's how 
I got the red mouth from my very first groupie.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Ean: A Dork</B></FONT> by G. Money<BR>
Ean Sicko is a dork. On stage his antics are silly.  He makes  faces, inane 
mic chatter, and sings about dumb shit.  He plays a flying V  guitar with a 
strap that says  METAL RULES. Could he be  more cutesy if he tried?  I'm 
surprised he hasn't started juggling or  riding a unicycle while performing
his stage antics.  I think maybe  he's bored and trying to entertain himself, 
but we'd all rather he  didn't make such a fool of himself, it embarrasses us.  
What a super  dork this guy is.  He's just lucky Josh and Denny are such big jerks.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Late Breaking News...<BR>
Top Drawer Records Is Dead</B></FONT> by Ean<BR>
Top Drawer Records, My and Carl's record label,  is now defunct.  This is 
mostly because of time constraints.  Carl has become increasingly involved in 
running Vox Populi, his art gallery, especially now that his partner Grant has 
moved to L.A. to pursue his writing career.  I have become increasingly involved 
with Sicko, and other neat projects like this newsletter.  The upshot is that 
neither of us has the time to keep the label running.  We're trying to find another 
label to pick up our back catalog, so if anybody is interested, just write in or 
email me.  If anybody has ordered stuff and not received their order, we're planning 
on sending it out, or at least sending you a refund.  Write or call if you're 
concerned about this as well.  Sicko will probably be releasing some more singles 
on it's own, through Empty records.  The notorious Cub/Sicko split 7" will be one 
of these releases.  Sicko T-shirts will also be available through Empty.
