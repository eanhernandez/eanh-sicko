three tea in the garden<BR>
on a sunny summer day<BR>
with the blackbirds and robins<BR>
and the green green garter snake<BR>
<P>
we set out a table <BR>
with cups and petits fours<BR>
the sun shines and we're able <BR>
to have tea served out of doors
<P>
the afternoon is looking up...
<P>
three tea in the garden<BR>
on a sunny summer day<BR>
with the blackbirds and robins<BR>
and the green green garter snake<BR>
<P>
black cat on a red brick wall<BR>
the wind blows and flowers fall<BR>
the vines grow up into the trees<BR>
my two best friends in the world and me

<I>The concept of "three tea" is taken from the brilliant<BR>
and deeply influential Beat Happening release "Three Tea <BR>
Breakfast".  Much credit is owed to Calvin, Heather and<BR>
Brett for this and MANY other things.</I>

<A NAME="Last"><B>Last Word</B></A><BR>
Misinterpret, that’s not what I meant at all<BR>
set yourself up for a fall, and you’ll fall<BR>
trip on the last curtain call<BR>
It doesn’t matter if I know of what I speak<BR>
the arguer’s strong if the argument’s weak<BR>
it’s persistance, insistence, and a nice healthy winning streak
<P>
I got the last word in, I’m happy to announce<BR>
I got the last word in and that’s all that counts<BR>
counting on you to throw in the towel before I do.
<P>
Keep talking, you can talk til the cows go home<BR>
til you wake up and find you’re alone<BR>
I went home, I went home with the cows.
<P>
I got the last word in, I’m happy to announce<BR>
I got the last word in and that’s all that counts<BR>
counting on you to throw in the towel before I do.

<A NAME="Steve"><B>Steve</B></A><BR>
if I had a dog his name would be Steve<BR>
and at the end of the day he'd be waiting for me<BR>
and he would listen and I would teach<BR>
and at the end of two years he would learn how to speak
<P>
he'd say<BR>
Ean<BR>
can I<BR>
borrow the car tonight<BR>
there's a <BR>
a dog <BR>
down the street that I kind of like
<P>
and so everywhere I would go there would be Steve<BR>
and on a Sunday afternoon quarter past three<BR>
we'd be reading the papers and drinking green tea<BR>
when Steve would take of his glasses and look straight at me
<P>
he'd say<BR>
Ean<BR>
can you<BR>
hand me section two<BR>
Steven<BR>
you know<BR>
I'd do anything for you
